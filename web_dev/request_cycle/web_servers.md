1. The main design philosophy of the Linux OS is that it's open source, meaning that the source code is freely available and modifiable.Linux is developed as a group effort, and there is not a single organization responsible for developing and testing it like there are for commercially available OSes.

2. A VPS is a chunk of memory that contains a virtual machine, which runs an operating system and can perform the functionalities of a normal computer. Some of the advantages of using a VPS are:
  *They are more reliable than a shared server because other websites won't affect their performance
  *You have more control than with a shared server
  *They are easily scaled from small to large without physically installing hardware
  *They are more cost effective for small websites
  *They're more environmentally friendly because one physical server's power consumption benefits a lot of people

3. It is dangerous to run programs as the root user in Linux because the root user has unlimited permissions, which means that you can accidentally cause damage to the entire system if you make a mistake. If you switch to a new user profile, you can't cause as much harm because you aren't an all-powerful user.
