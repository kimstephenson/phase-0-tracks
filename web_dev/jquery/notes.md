The first thing I'll do is google beginning resources and crash courses in jQuery. To avoid learning from one source like Codeacademy, I'll look for resources that are shorter and don't require you to sequentially progress through them, so that I can jump around to multiple resources. I will also try to find a handy cheat-sheet type guide that I can refer to later.

As far as testing what I'm learning, I'll code along with resources that include coding examples. Also, if I'm confused by anything I'm reading about, I'll try to work through it myself.

For an exercise like this, I don't think I need breaks. I'll just sit down and research for a dedicated block of time, because that kind of continuity helps me when learning about a new topic.
