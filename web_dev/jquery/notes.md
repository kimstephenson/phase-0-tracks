**Research Strategies**

The first thing I'll do is google beginning resources and crash courses in jQuery. To avoid learning from one source like Codeacademy, I'll look for resources that are shorter and don't require you to sequentially progress through them, so that I can jump around to multiple resources. I will also try to find a handy cheat-sheet type guide that I can refer to later.

As far as testing what I'm learning, I'll code along with resources that include coding examples. Also, if I'm confused by anything I'm reading about, I'll try to work through it myself.

For an exercise like this, I don't think I need breaks. I'll just sit down and research for a dedicated block of time, because that kind of continuity helps me when learning about a new topic.

**Notes**

I looked at multiple resources, but the best one I found that I have also used for past topics was the W3 Schools tutorial. Unlike with Codeacademy, you can jump around or easily skim things if you are trying to get a quick general overview of a subject.

The strategy that works best for me is finding one extremely descriptive, intensive resource as a "base" resource, and supplementing it with others when I'm confused about a specific topic or when I want something explained from a different point of view.
