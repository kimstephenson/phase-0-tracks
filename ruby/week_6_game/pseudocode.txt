#Create a Word Game class
#The class will have the following attributes:
#	-A word, which is a writable attribute received in the form of user input
#	-A count of the number of guesses made
	-A count of available guesses, which depends on the length of the word
#	-A boolean denoting whether the game is over (???)
#The class will have the following instance methods:
#	-A method that splits the word into characters and calculates total available 	
#	guesses
#	-A method that checks if the guessed letter is in the word and keeps track 
#	of the amount of guesses (only adding if the letter hasnâ€™t been guessed already)
#	-A method that prints a string of blanks the length of the answer, and fills in 
#	letters as correct guesses are made
#The driver code will do the following:
#	-Ask Player 1 for the word
#	-Print a statement that tells Player 2 how many guesses they have
#	-A loop that continually accepts guesses until the word is complete or they run
#	out of guesses. Also prints the updated feedback after each guess
#	-A congratulatory message if they win, or a taunting message if they lose
