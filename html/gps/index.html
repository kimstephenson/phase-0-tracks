<!-- HTML5 semantic tags are to make the code easier to read. Some of the most useful ones are nav, header/footer and section. The browser will read and display elements from top to bottom. Something useful I learned about Sublime in this challenge was how to use snippets, and I think I will definitely continue to use them in later challenges. The most difficult concept for me in this session was writing and using a Sublime snippet since it was the only new concept. I'll improve my understanding by continuing to practice using them. -->
